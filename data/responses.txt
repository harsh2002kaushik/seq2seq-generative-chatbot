<start>  did you put a stamp on the envelope ? <end>
<start>  i could not find any stamps . <end>
<start>  they are in the kitchen drawer . <end>
<start>  i am sleepy . <end>
<start>  why do not you go to bed ? <end>
<start>  i want to watch this tv show . <end>
<start>  maybe you should record it . <end>
<start>  the tape recorder is broken . <end>
<start>  then you should watch the rerun . <end>
<start>  why ? i am watching the original . <end>
<start>  but you will be asleep in about one minute . <end>
<start>  i am just yawning because the commercials are on . <end>
<start>  so ? <end>

<start>  sunday means we go to church . <end>
<start>  oh , yeah . <end>
<start>  put on a coat and tie . <end>
<start>  why ? <end>
<start>  to show respect to god and others . <end>
<start>  i am glad sunday is only once a week . <end>
<start>  i hope god did not hear that . <end>
<start>  he will forgive me . <end>
<start>  i will do that in a minute . <end>
<start>  the cat is meowing . he is hungry . <end>
<start>  okay . i will feed him right now . <end>
<start>  you should not make him wait . <end>
<start>  i was doing my homework . <end>
<start>  the cat does not care about your homework . <end>
<start>  the cat does not care about anything . <end>
<start>  that is the way cats are . <end>
<start>  all they think about is themselves . <end>
<start>  maybe we should get rid of him . <end>
<start>  of course not ! he is family . <end>
<start>  me too . <end>
<start>  i just cut myself again . <end>
<start>  did you use a new blade ? <end>
<start>  and grow a beard ? <end>
<start>  sure . why not ? <end>
<start>  because food and other stuff sticks in my beard . <end>
<start>  yes ? <end>
<start>  are you reading this paper ? <end>
<start>  oh , no . help yourself . <end>
<start>  yes , i know . some people are rude . <end>
<start>  i always try to be polite . <end>
<start>  so do i . <end>
<start>  the world needs more polite people like us . <end>
<start>  i agree 100 percent . <end>
<start>  let me think about it . <end>
<start>  why do you have to think about it ? <end>
<start>  because a puppy costs money . <end>
<start>  no , it doesn't . puppies are free . <end>
<start>  yes , but a puppy needs shots . <end>
<start>  shots for what ? <end>
<start>  and a puppy eats food . food costs money . <end>
<start>  how many are there ? <end>
<start>  eight . <end>
<start>  they are all so cute . <end>
<start>  yes , but i cannot keep them . <end>
<start>  what are you going to do with them ? <end>
<start>  which one do you want ? <end>
<start>  that one . the one that is all black . <end>
<start>  yes , i like that one , too . <end>
<start>  i will call him blacky . <end>
<start>  they trust in god . <end>
<start>  they hope they will go to heaven . <end>
<start>  they probably will . <end>
<start>  but no one knows for sure . <end>
<start>  that is for sure . <end>
<start>  no one knows what happens after we die . <end>
<start>  i am sorry for you . <end>
<start>  thank you . <end>
<start>  when did he die ? <end>
<start>  a couple of months ago . <end>
<start>  you still miss him . <end>
<start>  i buried him with his cell phone . <end>
<start>  what will you do when the battery dies ? <end>
<start>  that is a bad day . <end>
<start>  it is supposed to be unlucky . <end>
<start>  you are supposed to stay home all day . <end>
<start>  that is what i do . <end>
<start>  he stayed on the thirteenth floor . <end>
<start>  what happened ? <end>
<start>  someone stole his laptop . <end>
<start>  he was asking for it . <end>
<start>  he learned his lesson . he is home today . <end>
<start>  of course . <end>
<start>  prove it . <end>
<start>  how can i prove it ? <end>
<start>  take me to dinner . <end>
<start>  yes , and you have to make a reservation . <end>
<start>  that is such a hassle . <end>
<start>  i knew you did not love me . <end>
<start>  so are mine . <end>
<start>  why did your parents get divorced ? <end>
<start>  my father found a new girlfriend . <end>
<start>  that is too bad . <end>
<start>  my mother was hurt and angry . <end>
<start>  she had good reason . what did she do ? <end>
<start>  she told him to drop his girlfriend . <end>
<start>  what did your father do ? <end>
<start>  he moved out of our house . <end>
<start>  i guess he really liked his new girlfriend . <end>
<start>  yes , but she left him a year later . <end>
<start>  so does mine . <end>
<start>  i think it is an old people's smell . <end>
<start>  really ? <end>
<start>  yes , just like fruit that is too ripe . <end>
<start>  but the smell is different . <end>
<start>  yes , old people do not smell like fruit . <end>
<start>  no , they smell like a thrift shop . <end>
<start>  yes , a thrift shop has that same smell . <end>
<start>  yes , an old smell . <end>
<start>  i think stamps used to cost a penny . <end>
<start>  that was a long time ago . <end>
<start>  it was before i was born . <end>
<start>  now a stamp is 42 cents . <end>
<start>  but in may it will be 44 cents . <end>
<start>  have you ever lost a letter in the mail ? <end>
<start>  no , i haven't . <end>

<start>  maybe we should not complain . <end>
<start>  what are you going to do ? <end>
<start>  first , i have to find the button . <end>
<start>  where did you lose it ? <end>
<start>  i have no idea . <end>

<start>  but i love coffee . <end>
<start>  well , it is your life . <end>
<start>  you eat too much chocolate . <end>
<start>  i do not think so . <end>
<start>  have you looked in the mirror ? <end>
<start>  do you think i am getting fat ? <end>
<start>  i did not say that . <end>
<start>  what did you say ? <end>
<start>  i said i have to go to the bathroom . <end>

<start>  yes , i did . <end>
<start>  what did you wash ? <end>
<start>  i washed the sheets and towels . <end>
<start>  what about the pillowcases ? <end>
<start>  yes , i dried everything in the dryer . <end>
<start>  then what did you do ? <end>
<start>  i folded all the towels . <end>
<start>  did you put the sheets on the beds ? <end>

<start>  it is in the fridge , i think . <end>
<start>  how about some potato chips ? <end>
<start>  but , mom , i am not dirty . <end>
<start>  you need a bath every day . <end>
<start>  why ? <end>
<start>  because you do not want to smell bad . <end>
<start>  i do not smell bad . <end>
<start>  that is what you think . <end>
<start>  if i smelled bad , i could smell me . <end>
<start>  i can smell you . <end>
<start>  i can smell you , too . <end>
<start>  that is my perfume . <end>
<start>  when can i wear perfume ? <end>
<start>  exactly what ? <end>
<start>  all i get is a black screen . <end>
<start>  what is the matter ? <end>
<start>  i think i know , because this happened before . <end>
<start>  what happened before ? <end>
<start>  my hard drive crashed . <end>
<start>  oh , no . that is bad news . <end>
<start>  no , i always back up my files . <end>

<start>  that is correct . <end>

<start>  you should unplug the phone . <end>
<start>  that is a good idea . <end>
<start>  you mean i will smell the food cooking ? <end>
<start>  you might even dream about dinner . <end>
<start>  yes , dad , it was . <end>
<start>  the son gave a nice speech about his father . <end>
<start>  it was long , too . <end>
<start>  i think it was about 45 minutes long . <end>
<start>  but it went by fast . it was interesting . <end>
<start>  i liked it . <end>
<start>  of course . <end>
<start>  i think only the family will be there . <end>
<start>  i had to blow my nose . <end>
<start>  i thought you had an elephant in your house . <end>

<start>  rude people are everywhere . <end>
<start>  but what can you do ? <end>
<start>  you can yell at them . <end>
<start>  and they will yell back at you . <end>
<start>  yelling does not do any good . <end>
<start>  are you having problems with it ? <end>
<start>  i do not understand some things . <end>

<start>  that means it will get hotter . <end>
<start>  i am dying from the heat . <end>
<start>  turn on the air conditioner . <end>
<start>  it does not work . <end>
<start>  what happened ? <end>

<start>  of course . <end>
<start>  when is he coming ? <end>
<start>  he is busy . he said next week . <end>
<start>  why is that ? <end>

<start>  and it gives you money ? <end>

<start>  do they know what the robber looks like ? <end>
<start>  they did not say . <end>
<start>  but i do not have a tissue . <end>
<start>  then go find a tissue in the bathroom . <end>
<start>  but mom , all my friends use their sleeves . <end>
<start>  that does not make it right . <end>
<start>  worried about what ? <end>
<start>  i am getting married . <end>
<start>  you should be happy , not worried . <end>
<start>  are you going to start a family ? <end>
<start>  except we cannot afford it ! <end>
<start>  no wonder you are worried . <end>
<start>  or artists . <end>
<start>  they are in a different world . <end>
<start>  did you ever see anything that picasso painted ? <end>
<start>  of course ! he is world famous . <end>
<start>  did he ever take art lessons ? <end>
<start>  the point of what ? <end>
<start>  of living . <end>
<start>  maybe we are here to have fun . <end>
<start>  then why are not i having fun ? <end>
<start>  because you are thinking too much . <end>
<start>  so i should stop thinking ? <end>
<start>  stop thinking about what the point is . <end>
<start>  so are cigarettes . <end>
<start>  which would you prefer ? <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  yes . nothing's perfect , not even in heaven . <end>
<start>  boy , that is a tough one . <end>
<start>  you should not carry pens in your pocket . <end>
<start>  who carries a sharp knife in their pocket ? <end>
<start>  criminals , of course . <end>
<start>  anyway , i have to fix the hole . <end>
<start>  i cannot remember jokes . <end>

<start>  i wonder if every language has jokes . <end>
<start>  of course ! people everywhere like good jokes . <end>
<start>  what do you think people joke about the most ? <end>
<start>  i think most jokes are about women . <end>

<start>  you speak two languages . <end>
<start>  well , my english is not perfect . <end>

<start>  i will get her a nice card . <end>
<start>  is that it ? <end>
<start>  yes . that is all i ever give her . <end>
<start>  what is the matter with it ? <end>
<start>  it is too much like other flags . <end>
<start>  yes , a lot of flags have stripes . <end>
<start>  a flag should be pretty . <end>
<start>  what should our flag look like ? <end>
<start>  it should have a pretty woman on it . <end>
<start>  that is ridiculous ! <end>
<start>  you do not like pretty women ? <end>
<start>  what did you do ? <end>
<start>  i watered all the plants . <end>
<start>  you have a lot of plants . <end>

<start>  the seats and windows are dirty . <end>
<start>  do not they clean the bus every night ? <end>
<start>  i think they do . <end>
<start>  you should bring some wipes with you . <end>
<start>  that is a good idea . <end>
<start>  then you can wipe your seat and window . <end>
<start>  people will think i am strange . <end>
<start>  who cares ? everyone is strange . <end>
<start>  that is for sure . <end>
<start>  do not worry about what people think . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>
<start>  number one , it is too slow . <end>

<start>  so ? that is a ticket ? <end>
<start>  yes , it is a $ 140 ticket . <end>
<start>  that is not right ! <end>
<start>  why do you say that ? <end>
<start>  the speed limit is 65 . <end>
<start>  i know that . <end>
<start>  but you are doing 75 . <end>
<start>  so is everyone else . <end>
<start>  but a cop might stop you . <end>
<start>  of course . he stops the fastest cars . <end>
<start>  my friend got a ticket for doing 75 . <end>
<start>  your friend was unlucky . <end>
<start>  how often do i have to do that ? <end>
<start>  once every two months . <end>
<start>  that is a lot . <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  that is six times a year ! <end>
<start>  check your tires or you will get a flat . <end>
<start>  oh . that is not good . <end>
<start>  i am in a hurry . <end>
<start>  do not ever be in a hurry . <end>
<start>  i read a lot . <end>
<start>  i thought drunks caused most accidents . <end>
<start>  where are we going ? <end>
<start>  into the mountains . <end>
<start>  that sounds nice . <end>
<start>  i want to show you my new car . <end>
<start>  you bought a new car ? <end>
<start>  yes . i bought a cadillac . <end>
<start>  a luxury car . <end>
<start>  luxury plus speed . <end>
<start>  what are we waiting for ? <end>
<start>  let me get the keys . <end>
<start>  let me get my camera . <end>
<start>  why did not you go before we left ? <end>
<start>  i did , but i have to go again . <end>
<start>  well , hold on a little longer . <end>
<start>  i think i am going to explode . <end>
<start>  just hold on . <end>
<start>  oh ! do not hit any more bumps ! <end>
<start>  think about something else . think about a hamburger . <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  the car is not here . <end>
<start>  where did you park it ? <end>
<start>  i parked it right here . <end>
<start>  are you sure ? <end>
<start>  yes . i remember this big tree . <end>
<start>  maybe it is the wrong tree . <end>
<start>  no , this is the tree . <end>
<start>  did someone steal it ? <end>
<start>  i sure hope not . <end>
<start>  maybe they towed it away . <end>
<start>  i would rather not . <end>
<start>  it gets worse every year . <end>
<start>  well , that is between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m . <end>
<start>  where are all these people going ? <end>
<start>  they are all asking the same question . <end>
<start>  when are they going to fix this problem ? <end>
<start>  they said they need more money . <end>
<start>  they always need more money . <end>
<start>  it will get worse before it gets better . <end>
<start>  yes , he went through the red light . <end>
<start>  can we call the police ? <end>
<start>  no , the police do not care . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>
<start>  they have to see it happen . <end>
<start>  they do not believe us ? <end>
<start>  we do not do anything . <end>
<start>  maybe we should honk the horn next time . <end>
<start>  the driver will just honk back at us . <end>
<start>  why do not you wash it ? <end>
<start>  that is what i am going to do . <end>
<start>  are you going to wash it yourself ? <end>
<start>  of course . it is not a hard job . <end>
<start>  i will help you . <end>
<start>  okay , i will get a bucket . <end>
<start>  i will rinse the car first . <end>
<start>  and you save $ 10 . <end>
<start>  paper is flying everywhere . <end>
<start>  this wind is dangerous for drivers . <end>
<start>  especially for drivers of big trucks . <end>
<start>  the wind blows those trucks over . <end>
<start>  it blows trees over , too . <end>
<start>  a tree fell onto my dad's car . <end>
<start>  was there much damage ? <end>
<start>  my dad had to buy a new car . <end>
<start>  wow ! that is terrible . <end>
<start>  never park your car under a tree . <end>
<start>  we will stop at the next mcdonald's . <end>
<start>  how far away is that ? <end>
<start>  no , thank you , i will just wait . <end>
<start>  we can kill two birds with one stone . <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  look how many cars are waiting in line . <end>
<start>  they need a left-turn arrow . <end>
<start>  get out of this lane . <end>
<start>  but we need to turn left . <end>
<start>  forget it . go straight . <end>
<start>  then what ? <end>
<start>  then we will just make a u-turn . <end>
<start>  and then we can turn right at the light . <end>
<start>  good idea . it will be so much quicker . <end>
<start>  how much money do you have ? <end>
<start>  $ 1,000 . <end>
<start>  well , that should get you something . <end>
<start>  but i need something that is reliable . <end>
<start>  you need a car with low mileage . <end>
<start>  i have not looked anywhere yet . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>

<start>  no , i was in the crosswalk . <end>
<start>  so why did you get a ticket ? <end>
<start>  the officer said the red hand was blinking . <end>
<start>  was it blinking when you entered the crosswalk ? <end>
<start>  no , the white walk sign was blinking . <end>
<start>  two students from usc . <end>
<start>  what happened ? <end>
<start>  he landed on the hood of the car . <end>
<start>  did he get off the hood ? <end>

<start>  okay . teach me how to play . <end>
<start>  we each get five cards . <end>
<start>  oh , look . i have four tens . <end>
<start>  why is that ? <end>
<start>  because i watch the other players . <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  nope , and it drives him crazy . <end>
<start>  but i am listening to it . <end>
<start>  well , listen to it more quietly . <end>
<start>  i cannot wait till i grow up . <end>
<start>  what will you do ? <end>
<start>  all the radios will be on extra loud . <end>
<start>  your neighbors will hate you . <end>
<start>  your chances are very small . <end>
<start>  but you cannot win if you do not play . <end>
<start>  ha ! you cannot win if you do play . <end>
<start>  someone has to win . <end>
<start>  that is what everyone says . <end>
<start>  it might as well be me . <end>
<start>  that is what everyone says . <end>
<start>  you are trying to tell me something . <end>
<start>  that did not take long . <end>
<start>  you think i should quit playing . <end>
<start>  save your money for school . <end>
<start>  nothing much . <end>
<start>  what about the baseball game ? <end>
<start>  it got rained out . <end>
<start>  rained out ? <end>
<start>  yes , rained out . <end>
<start>  how could that be ? <end>
<start>  well , you cannot play baseball in a rainstorm . <end>
<start>  i thought they were playing under a dome . <end>
<start>  the dome does not close . <end>
<start>  why does not it close ? <end>
<start>  sure . here you go . <end>
<start>  hmm , that is not bad . <end>
<start>  there is nothing in it . <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  i mean , it is just coffee . <end>
<start>  i figured that . <end>
<start>  it is not too bitter for you ? <end>
<start>  what is the weather like ? <end>
<start>  let me step outside and see . <end>
<start>  it is a little chilly , right ? <end>

<start>  i wonder if i should bring my gloves . <end>
<start>  we will get warmer as we walk . <end>
<start>  that driver is crazy . <end>
<start>  i cannot believe he has not crashed . <end>
<start>  how fast is he going ? <end>
<start>  they say he is going 80 miles per hour . <end>
<start>  he is going to kill someone . <end>
<start>  look ! he just hit that car . <end>
<start>  maybe he ran out of gas . <end>
<start>  they should not even call it news . <end>
<start>  the sports guy shows us players fighting . <end>
<start>  they always tell us " what's next <end>
<start>  they should have kid reporters . <end>
<start>  computers are so cool . <end>

<start>  what would you like to see ? <end>
<start>  i like to watch people . <end>
<start>  that is your favorite thing to do ? <end>
<start>  well , it is one of them . <end>
<start>  where do you go to watch people ? <end>
<start>  my girlfriend and i sit outside starbucks . <end>
<start>  that sounds like a good spot . <end>
<start>  we watch people walk by with their dogs . <end>
<start>  i guess you see lots of different dogs . <end>
<start>  yes , he was on the tv news today . <end>
<start>  every easter sunday he gives away money . <end>
<start>  is it his money ? <end>
<start>  this year he gave away $ 15,000 . <end>
<start>  that is a lot of money . <end>
<start>  he gave $ 100 to people in wheelchairs . <end>
<start>  what about the other homeless people ? <end>
<start>  they got $ 1 each . <end>
<start>  people stood in line just to get one dollar <end>
<start>  even though they are in black and white . <end>
<start>  a good story is more important than color . <end>
<start>  actors did not curse back then . <end>
<start>  and there was no violence . <end>
<start>  people today do not like that . <end>
<start>  no , today people like lots of action . <end>
<start>  i like a good story . <end>
<start>  they still make movies like that . <end>
<start>  yes , but they never make much money . <end>
<start>  yes , everybody gets the public broadcasting system . <end>
<start>  it puts me to sleep . <end>

<start>  a gardening show follows a knitting show . <end>
<start>  a cooking show follows a sewing show . <end>
<start>  a travel show follows another travel show . <end>
<start>  is that a tv show ? <end>
<start>  yes . it is on every afternoon . <end>
<start>  what is so good about it ? <end>
<start>  they have interesting lawsuits . <end>
<start>  such as ? <end>

<start>  did the seller know that ? <end>
<start>  yes , and he did not tell the buyer . <end>
<start>  yes , but she looks like a man . <end>
<start>  what difference does it make ? <end>
<start>  female singers are supposed to be pretty . <end>
<start>  singers are supposed to sound good . <end>
<start>  they should look good , too . <end>
<start>  there are lots of ugly men singers . <end>
<start>  men singers do not have to look good . <end>
<start>  then neither do women singers . <end>
<start>  well , i would never buy her cd . <end>
<start>  yes , that will occur next month . <end>
<start>  most of them are already broadcasting in digital . <end>
<start>  the digital signal is very clear . <end>
<start>  oh , no , it isn't ! <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  i cannot get a single channel . <end>
<start>  do you have a digital tv ? <end>
<start>  of course . but i do not have cable . <end>

<start>  i would like to . <end>
<start>  can i pick you up friday night ? <end>
<start>  what time ? <end>
<start>  eight o'clock . <end>
<start>  that sounds great . <end>
<start>  we will go to a french restaurant . <end>
<start>  i have never been to a french restaurant . <end>
<start>  i think you will love the food . <end>
<start>  i am not going to eat any snails ! <end>
<start>  thank you . so do you . <end>
<start>  i wish my eyes were blue . <end>
<start>  what is the matter with green eyes ? <end>
<start>  nothing , except my favorite color is blue . <end>
<start>  cats have beautiful eyes . <end>
<start>  i would love to have blue cat-eyes . <end>
<start>  i love you , too . <end>
<start>  i loved you the first day i saw you . <end>
<start>  it was love at first sight ? <end>
<start>  yes , it was love at first sight . <end>
<start>  i did not love you at first . <end>
<start>  and you are mine forever . <end>
<start>  we will grow old together . <end>
<start>  and be happy together . <end>
<start>  have you told her ? <end>
<start>  of course not . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>
<start>  she would laugh at me . <end>
<start>  how do you know ? <end>
<start>  because they always do . <end>
<start>  maybe she is different . <end>
<start>  they are all the same . <end>
<start>  just ask her out to dinner . <end>
<start>  and then what ? <end>
<start>  and then she will know that you like her . <end>
<start>  i am not in the mood . <end>
<start>  what is the matter ? <end>
<start>  i saw you looking at that woman . <end>
<start>  what woman ? <end>
<start>  you know , that woman with the big boobs . <end>
<start>  i was not looking at her . <end>
<start>  you were , too . <end>
<start>  i am not interested in her . <end>
<start>  then why were you looking at her ? <end>
<start>  i was looking at something else . <end>
<start>  you must be joking . <end>
<start>  no , i am serious . <end>
<start>  i do not want to date a blind woman . <end>
<start>  what if i do not like her ? <end>
<start>  then you do not date her again . <end>
<start>  really ? who with ? <end>
<start>  a girl i met at the market . <end>
<start>  you met a girl at the supermarket ? <end>
<start>  yes , in fact , i did . <end>
<start>  who did you go out with ? <end>
<start>  a man i met in a coffee shop . <end>
<start>  where did you go ? <end>
<start>  we went to a nice restaurant . <end>
<start>  anywhere else ? <end>
<start>  then we went to a jazz club . <end>
<start>  that sounds like a nice date . <end>
<start>  yes , it was pleasant . <end>
<start>  but you will not date him again ? <end>
<start>  what happened ? <end>
<start>  then he did not bother to apologize . <end>
<start>  that is rude . <end>
<start>  then he drove too fast to the restaurant . <end>
<start>  that is dangerous . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>
<start>  he is a dirty old man . <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  he should act his age . <end>
<start>  just wait until you are 50 years old . <end>
<start>  dating will be the furthest thing from my mind . <end>
<start>  sometimes . <end>
<start>  what does she do ? <end>
<start>  that is what i thought . <end>
<start>  what did she say ? <end>
<start>  she laughed ! she did not believe me . <end>
<start>  that was not very nice of her . <end>
<start>  oh . but that can be a curse . <end>
<start>  that sounds like fun . <end>
<start>  where do you want to go ? <end>
<start>  let me think a minute . <end>
<start>  i feel like chinese . <end>
<start>  that sounds delicious . <end>
<start>  i know a good chinese restaurant . <end>
<start>  how far away is it ? <end>
<start>  it is only 10 minutes from here . <end>
<start>  do we need reservations ? <end>
<start>  oh , no . we can walk right in . <end>
<start>  let us go now . i am hungry ! <end>
<start>  this is a popular restaurant , is not it ? <end>
<start>  that is because they cook it while you wait . <end>
<start>  yes , the workers are very polite . <end>
<start>  and they are clean . <end>
<start>  i have been coming here for years . <end>
<start>  me too . <end>
<start>  excuse me . they just called my number . <end>
<start>  thank you . <end>
<start>  what kind of soup was that ? <end>
<start>  it was tomato soup . <end>
<start>  that tasted so good . <end>
<start>  i put lemon and butter in it . <end>
<start>  the sandwich was good , too . <end>
<start>  everyone likes bacon and tomato sandwiches . <end>
<start>  especially on toast . <end>
<start>  and the pickles were great , too . <end>
<start>  tomorrow we will have rice and fish for lunch . <end>
<start>  i cannot wait . <end>
<start>  what is the matter ? <end>
<start>  this steak has too much fat . <end>
<start>  what do you want the waiter to do ? <end>
<start>  bring me a better steak . <end>
<start>  i would not do that . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>
<start>  i used to cook in a restaurant ! <end>
<start>  but we just got here . <end>
<start>  did you see the waiter's hands ? <end>
<start>  no . <end>
<start>  he had dirty fingernails . <end>
<start>  really ? <end>
<start>  his nails were black ! <end>
<start>  that is disgusting . <end>
<start>  and he poured water into our glasses . <end>
<start>  yuck ! no water for me . <end>
<start>  well , the tables and chairs look okay . <end>
<start>  okay , let us sit down . <end>
<start>  check out the silverware . <end>
<start>  it passes inspection . <end>
<start>  here he comes now . <end>
<start>  we have been sitting here for almost 10 minutes . <end>
<start>  well , there is one good table . <end>
<start>  great . which one ? <end>
<start>  what is it this time ? <end>
<start>  an andy warhol drawing . <end>
<start>  he is a famous artist . <end>
<start>  yes . <end>
<start>  is it beautiful ? <end>
<start>  only about $ 30,000 . <end>
<start>  of course . <end>
<start>  i love baseball . <end>
<start>  so do i . <end>
<start>  i love to eat the peanuts . <end>
<start>  i love to eat the hot dogs . <end>
<start>  i hope we will see a home run . <end>
<start>  i hope we will catch a foul ball . <end>
<start>  bring a jacket . <end>
<start>  yes . it gets a little cool at night . <end>
<start>  bring a glove to catch a foul ball . <end>
<start>  it certainly is . <end>
<start>  you hit a white ball . <end>
<start>  and then you chase it . <end>
<start>  and then you hit it again . <end>
<start>  how can it be fun ? <end>
<start>  they pay money to play this silly game ! <end>
<start>  i think golfers have a mental problem . <end>
<start>  i think they are nuts . <end>
<start>  yes . that is a good idea . <end>
<start>  where do you want to go ? <end>
<start>  we can go to the river . <end>
<start>  or we can go to the lake . <end>
<start>  or we can go to the ocean . <end>
<start>  let us go to the lake . <end>
<start>  yes . the lake is only 10 miles away . <end>
<start>  we can be there in 20 minutes . <end>
<start>  i will get our fishing rods . <end>
<start>  i will get the bait . <end>
<start>  we will have fresh fish for dinner ! <end>
<start>  i like to hit the ball . <end>
<start>  i like to run around the bases . <end>
<start>  i like to slide into the bases . <end>
<start>  i do not like practice . <end>
<start>  me neither . it is boring . <end>
<start>  but practice makes perfect . <end>
<start>  that is a good idea . <end>
<start>  i bought some new shoes . <end>
<start>  are they comfortable ? <end>
<start>  they are very comfortable . <end>
<start>  how much were they ? <end>
<start>  they were on sale for $ 80 . <end>
<start>  do they help you run faster ? <end>
<start>  no , but my feet do not hurt anymore . <end>
<start>  then they are worth every penny . <end>
<start>  you might want to buy a pair . <end>
<start>  i will wait until i wear this pair out . <end>
<start>  you can say that again . <end>
<start>  but i am worried about tiger . <end>
<start>  why is that ? <end>
<start>  because he likes to scuba dive . <end>
<start>  what is wrong with that ? <end>
<start>  it can be dangerous . <end>
<start>  you mean he could drown . <end>
<start>  he should not scuba dive until he retires . <end>
<start>  but he dives to relax . <end>
<start>  he might relax , but it makes me nervous . <end>
<start>  the one that tiger won ? <end>
<start>  how did he do it ? <end>
<start>  it was nothing for him . <end>
<start>  no human could possibly play golf that well . <end>
<start>  somebody should check his birth record . <end>
<start>  i bet it says he was born on mars . <end>
<start>  there are so many great players . <end>
<start>  yes , but who is the greatest ? <end>
<start>  i would have to say babe ruth . <end>
<start>  most people would say that . <end>
<start>  he changed the game . <end>
<start>  yes , he made the home run popular . <end>
<start>  everybody loved him , all over the nation . <end>
<start>  he helped make the yankees the best team ever . <end>
<start>  and ruth was a good person , too . <end>
<start>  he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids . <end>
<start>  there will never be another babe . <end>
<start>  no , please tell me . <end>
<start>  someone punched out someone . <end>
<start>  that is not nice . <end>
<start>  it is worse than that . <end>
<start>  how so ? <end>
<start>  two guys got into an argument . <end>
<start>  i will bet they were drinking . <end>
<start>  a third guy punched one of the two guys . <end>
<start>  i will bet he was drinking , too . <end>
<start>  is there a game tonight ? <end>
<start>  yes , it starts at 7 p.m . <end>
<start>  can we get tickets ? <end>
<start>  yes , but only the cheap tickets . <end>
<start>  how much are they ? <end>
<start>  they are only $ 5 each . <end>
<start>  that is a good price . <end>
<start>  they are behind the outfield . <end>
<start>  maybe we can catch a home run ball . <end>
<start>  no , like a good amateur golfer . <end>
<start>  what is so hard about golf ? <end>
<start>  the home run hitter on drugs ? <end>
<start>  he apologized to the fans . <end>
<start>  the league suspended him for 50 games . <end>
<start>  that will cost him some money . <end>
<start>  yes , about $ 7 million . <end>
<start>  that will teach him a good lesson . <end>
<start>  he probably will not use drugs anymore . <end>
<start>  also , there are not enough police . <end>
<start>  but there are a lot of police . <end>
<start>  there is only one police officer per 100 criminals . <end>
<start>  cannot we hire more police ? <end>
<start>  no . it costs too much money . <end>
<start>  does not crime cost more than police ? <end>
<start>  yes , it does . <end>
<start>  so it would be cheaper to hire more police ? <end>
<start>  yes , it would . <end>
<start>  yes , it is . <end>
<start>  people are friendly . <end>
<start>  yes , they are . <end>
<start>  the streets and sidewalks are clean . <end>
<start>  yes , they are . <end>
<start>  there is a real nice park nearby . <end>
<start>  yes , there is . <end>
<start>  i feel safe here . <end>
<start>  there is no crime here . <end>
<start>  i wish i could move here . <end>
<start>  maybe you can , if someone moves out . <end>
<start>  what happened ? <end>
<start>  the man fell asleep . <end>
<start>  was he smoking ? <end>
<start>  yes , he was smoking a cigarette . <end>
<start>  did he die ? <end>
<start>  a good battery would have saved his life . <end>
<start>  he had cigarettes , but no battery . <end>
<start>  it happens all the time . <end>
<start>  he is been in jail three times already . <end>
<start>  why did they ever let him out ? <end>
<start>  this time they have charged him with murder . <end>
<start>  so maybe he will go to jail forever ? <end>
<start>  i sure hope so . <end>
<start>  someone should set him on fire . <end>
<start>  that would teach him a good lesson . <end>
<start>  why ? <end>
<start>  it is the law . <end>
<start>  it is so much trouble . <end>
<start>  it is common sense . <end>
<start>  okay , my seatbelt is on . <end>
<start>  i am glad you do not complain very much . <end>
<start>  i am ready for an accident . <end>
<start>  a couple of dictionaries and some textbooks . <end>
<start>  are you crazy ? <end>
<start>  what is the matter ? <end>
<start>  those books will slip and you will fall . <end>
<start>  it is only a couple of feet . <end>
<start>  a puddle of water is very dangerous . <end>
<start>  it is not easy to see . <end>
<start>  but it is real easy to slip on . <end>
<start>  especially on these slick floors . <end>
<start>  someone who slips could hurt their back . <end>
<start>  they could even crack their head open . <end>
<start>  we tell our students to leave the classroom . <end>
<start>  can they take their belongings ? <end>
<start>  yes , if they do it quickly . <end>
<start>  where do the students go ? <end>
<start>  they go out to the north parking lot . <end>
<start>  what do the teachers do ? <end>
<start>  why ? we are already late . <end>
<start>  i have to check the stove . <end>
<start>  what is the matter ? <end>
<start>  maybe i left the burner on . <end>
<start>  of course i am sure . <end>
<start>  well , i have to go back upstairs anyway . <end>
<start>  it is getting later every minute . <end>
<start>  i think i left the water running . <end>
<start>  what are they paying ? <end>
<start>  they want to get guns off the street . <end>
<start>  who would turn in a gun for $ 200 ? <end>
<start>  that is not a good deal ? <end>
<start>  a good gun costs $ 400 or more . <end>
<start>  i did not know you had a gun . <end>
<start>  everyone in america should have a gun . <end>
<start>  i sure am . <end>
<start>  you should go to bed . <end>
<start>  i will as soon as i finish this article . <end>
<start>  what are you reading ? <end>
<start>  it is about crime in los angeles . <end>
<start>  what does it say ? <end>
<start>  the mayor says the crime rate is going down . <end>
<start>  then why does everyone lock their doors ? <end>
<start>  i guess they have not read this article . <end>
<start>  why is that ? <end>
<start>  because of all the earthquakes and fires . <end>
<start>  but big earthquakes happen only once in a while . <end>
<start>  once in a while is once too many . <end>
<start>  still , it is safer than florida . <end>
<start>  florida does not have earthquakes or fires . <end>
<start>  excuse me . hurricane andrew destroyed 30,000 homes ! <end>
<start>  did you like it ? <end>
<start>  i loved it . i want to live there . <end>
<start>  what did you like ? <end>
<start>  i went to the beach every day . <end>
<start>  how was the weather ? <end>
<start>  it was hot and sunny every day . <end>
<start>  what did you do at night ? <end>

<start>  no pets , no smoking . <end>
<start>  i like that . let us stay three nights . <end>
<start>  look at this sheet . <end>
<start>  yes ? <end>
<start>  see those stains ? <end>
<start>  i sure do . <end>
<start>  i am not sleeping on that sheet . <end>
<start>  it leaves at 12:15 . <end>
<start>  when do you have to be at the airport ? <end>
<start>  i have to be there two hours early . <end>
<start>  you never know what might happen on these freeways . <end>
<start>  there is at least one huge accident every day . <end>
<start>  when are you going ? <end>
<start>  during the christmas holidays . <end>
<start>  you would better buy your ticket now . <end>
<start>  you must be kidding . <end>
<start>  so do i . <end>
<start>  you are jammed in with people all around you . <end>
<start>  kids are crying or climbing over you . <end>
<start>  it is a flying zoo ! <end>
<start>  i wish i could afford first class seats . <end>
<start>  does not everybody ? <end>
<start>  good for him . <end>
<start>  why would he do that ? <end>
<start>  did he set a new record ? <end>
<start>  yes , i think he did . <end>
<start>  now he has the world record ! <end>
<start>  no , my sister and i will travel together . <end>
<start>  because of all the security ? <end>
<start>  no , because it hurts my ears . <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  whatever it is , it hurts . <end>
<start>  cannot you take medicine or something for it ? <end>
<start>  i have tried everything , but nothing works . <end>
<start>  have you tried earplugs ? <end>
<start>  they do not work , either . <end>
<start>  well , be glad you are not a pilot . <end>
<start>  are you going to go anywhere ? <end>
<start>  i was thinking of driving to arizona . <end>
<start>  to the grand canyon ? <end>
<start>  yes . i have never been there . <end>
<start>  i was there when i was a kid . <end>
<start>  how did you like it ? <end>
<start>  the worst in the whole world . <end>
<start>  the walls were so thin . <end>
<start>  all day long we heard tvs or telephones . <end>
<start>  all night long we heard people snoring . <end>
<start>  housekeeping did not give us fresh towels . <end>
<start>  room service brought us a cold dinner . <end>
<start>  our nonsmoking room stunk of cigarette smoke . <end>
<start>  how did we end up in that terrible hotel ? <end>
<start>  the travel agent gave us a 50-percent discount ! <end>
<start>  i am falling asleep on the phone . <end>
<start>  you got up real early . <end>
<start>  i had to take my friend to the airport . <end>
<start>  why is that ? <end>
<start>  there was a bomb threat at the airport . <end>
<start>  only a threat ? <end>
<start>  why did he do that ? <end>
<start>  some private organization . <end>
<start>  why did they invite him ? <end>
<start>  he said all the money came from private donations . <end>
<start>  tell me about it , dad . <end>
<start>  it only took about two hours . <end>
<start>  i thought you had a job . <end>
<start>  i did . <end>
<start>  what happened ? <end>
<start>  i got laid off . <end>
<start>  that is terrible ! when did it happen ? <end>
<start>  i got laid off last week . <end>
<start>  just you ? <end>
<start>  i am looking in the newspaper for a job . <end>
<start>  good luck ! <end>
<start>  what is to check ? <end>
<start>  are your nails clean ? <end>
<start>  yes , they are . <end>
<start>  did you double-check your nose and teeth ? <end>
<start>  they are clean , too . <end>
<start>  did you shine your shoes ? <end>
<start>  my shoes are shined . <end>
<start>  do your socks match ? <end>
<start>  of course they match . <end>
<start>  it sure is . <end>
<start>  i thought school was hard . <end>
<start>  me , too . school was fun . <end>
<start>  and it was only 12 years . <end>
<start>  it went by pretty fast . <end>
<start>  but work goes on forever ! <end>
<start>  we have to work for 30 years ! <end>
<start>  so am i . <end>
<start>  i had a long day . <end>
<start>  so did i . <end>
<start>  i did not even have lunch . <end>
<start>  neither did i . <end>
<start>  i was busy the whole day . <end>
<start>  so was i . <end>
<start>  i had to bring work home with me . <end>
<start>  i did too . <end>
<start>  your day was just like mine . <end>
<start>  of course it was . we work together ! <end>
<start>  what do you do ? <end>
<start>  i am a babysitter . <end>
<start>  is that a lot of work ? <end>
<start>  babies cry all the time . <end>
<start>  you have to change their diapers . <end>
<start>  i have to feed them . <end>
<start>  are you looking for another job ? <end>
<start>  no , i am looking for another family . <end>
<start>  another family ? <end>
<start>  a family with only one baby . <end>
<start>  that is a good idea . <end>
<start>  what was your last job ? <end>
<start>  i was a painter . <end>
<start>  what happened ? <end>
<start>  i got laid off because there was no work . <end>
<start>  what else can you do ? <end>
<start>  i am a handyman . <end>
<start>  okay . that sounds like a fair price . <end>
<start>  well , i know how to flip hamburgers . <end>
<start>  no one would hire you to flip hamburgers . <end>
<start>  are there going to be layoffs at this place ? <end>
<start>  i certainly hope not ! <end>
<start>  teaching is a great job . <end>
<start>  it is the best job i have ever had . <end>
<start>  what makes it so good ? <end>
<start>  for me , it is the students . <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  i mean i have wonderful students . <end>
<start>  that must be nice . <end>
<start>  teaching is the best part of my whole day . <end>
<start>  how long did it take ? <end>
<start>  four hours , without a break . <end>
<start>  it is always nice to finish a job . <end>
<start>  well , it is good and bad . <end>
<start>  what is bad about it ? <end>
<start>  he is rude and he yells a lot . <end>
<start>  that is hard to take . <end>
<start>  no one at work likes him . <end>
<start>  cannot you report him to his supervisor ? <end>
<start>  about what ? <end>
<start>  about finding a job for me . <end>
<start>  i am not sure . <end>
<start>  well , you should do something that you enjoy . <end>
<start>  i enjoy selling . i was born to sell . <end>
<start>  okay , what do you want to sell ? <end>
<start>  cigarette lighters . i will make a fortune . <end>
<start>  but you hate cigarettes and you hate smoking ! <end>
<start>  yes , i saw it on the tv news . <end>
<start>  they need 300 new workers . <end>
<start>  and 4,000 people showed up . <end>
<start>  so many people are out of work . <end>
<start>  i still have my job , thank goodness . <end>
<start>  so do i , but i am worried . <end>
<start>  me too . there are no guarantees . <end>
<start>  of course . what are friends for ? <end>
<start>  what did you do ? <end>
<start>  i bought some stock . <end>
<start>  everybody buys stock . <end>
<start>  i bought it on a hunch . <end>
<start>  you did not read about the company first ? <end>
<start>  i used all my savings on this one company . <end>
<start>  you put all your eggs into one basket . <end>
<start>  what happened to your plans ? <end>
<start>  i got a d in college chemistry . <end>
<start>  well , a d is better than an f . <end>
<start>  a tutor helped me get the d ! <end>
<start>  so , you did not become a doctor . <end>
<start>  and now i am glad that i didn't . <end>
<start>  why is that ? <end>
<start>  because you get to meet a lot of people . <end>
<start>  you sure do . <end>
<start>  and you get a lot of exercise every day . <end>
<start>  that is the truth . <end>
<start>  to the state or the city ? <end>
<start>  to the city , of course . <end>
<start>  why do you want to move there ? <end>
<start>  because i want to make a lot of money . <end>
<start>  so how do you plan to become rich ? <end>
<start>  all you will get is sore knuckles . <end>
<start>  me too . <end>
<start>  i usually eat a simple salad . <end>
<start>  what do you put in it ? <end>
<start>  just lettuce , tomato , and celery . <end>
<start>  that is it ? <end>
<start>  i add some pepper and salt . <end>
<start>  i always put cheese in my salads . <end>
<start>  yes , cheese is nice . <end>
<start>  what kind of dressing do you use ? <end>
<start>  i pour lots of french dressing on top . <end>
<start>  me too . <end>
<start>  where does cheese come from ? <end>
<start>  it comes from cows . <end>
<start>  what else do we get from cows ? <end>
<start>  we get hamburgers and steak . <end>
<start>  oh , that is so delicious . <end>
<start>  we also get leather . <end>
<start>  how did you like it ? <end>
<start>  i loved it ! <end>
<start>  did you get free food ? <end>
<start>  i ate free cheese and meat every day . <end>
<start>  that sounds like a great job . <end>
<start>  what are you eating now ? <end>
<start>  i switched from pasta to potatoes . <end>
<start>  why did you do that ? <end>
<start>  pasta is processed food . potatoes are natural food . <end>
<start>  natural food has more vitamins . <end>
<start>  and it is just as easy to prepare . <end>
<start>  how do you prepare the potatoes ? <end>
<start>  then i add butter , salt , and pepper . <end>
<start>  her mom is a great cook . <end>
<start>  oh . <end>
<start>  you are kidding . <end>
<start>  no , i am serious . <end>
<start>  does not that get old ? <end>
<start>  no , i hate vegetables . <end>
<start>  but you eat fruits . <end>
<start>  what is wrong ? <end>
<start>  it is not orange ! <end>
<start>  your orange is not orange ? <end>
<start>  no , it is dark pink ! <end>
<start>  boiled ? i never heard of that . <end>
<start>  they are best when they are hot . <end>
<start>  my brother is allergic to peanuts . <end>
<start>  that is not good . <end>
<start>  how much have you gained ? <end>
<start>  three pounds just this month . <end>
<start>  do you know why ? <end>
<start>  i think it is the ice cream . <end>
<start>  you started eating ice cream ? <end>
<start>  it was on sale . <end>
<start>  how much did you buy ? <end>
<start>  i filled up my freezer with ice cream . <end>
<start>  well , it will not last forever . <end>
<start>  you like to see it disappear . <end>
<start>  i do not like it reheated . <end>
<start>  you should loosen your belt . <end>
<start>  i already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants . <end>
<start>  well , do not stand up , please . <end>
<start>  i did not do anything . <end>
<start>  oh yes , you did . <end>
<start>  what are you talking about ? <end>
<start>  you know what i am talking about . <end>
<start>  i do not have any idea . <end>
<start>  you know what you did . <end>
<start>  maybe i know , but how could you know ? <end>
<start>  because i was watching you . <end>
<start>  okay , i am sorry i did it . <end>
<start>  so do i . <end>
<start>  how much is it ? <end>
<start>  i do not know . the tag is missing . <end>
<start>  ask the clerk . <end>
<start>  i will . <end>
<start>  i think i will buy both of them . <end>
<start>  you would better try them on first . <end>
<start>  thank you . <end>
<start>  i hope they fit . <end>
<start>  i hope you kept the receipt . <end>
<start>  you think they will not fit ? <end>
<start>  i think i have put on some weight . <end>
<start>  you think ? <end>
<start>  maybe a pound or two . <end>
<start>  maybe four or five pounds ? <end>
<start>  my waist is bigger than it was . <end>
<start>  no problem . these pants have an elastic waistband . <end>
<start>  you are so smart ! <end>
<start>  let me look at our list . <end>
<start>  i know that we need milk . <end>
<start>  nonfat . <end>
<start>  of course . what else ? <end>
<start>  we need cheese , bread , and ham . <end>
<start>  what kind of cheese ? <end>
<start>  swiss . <end>
<start>  of course , the cheese with holes in it . <end>
<start>  i never used to buy swiss cheese . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>
<start>  i did not want to pay for the holes . <end>
<start>  i thought you just bought a pair . <end>
<start>  i did . <end>
<start>  what is wrong with them so soon ? <end>
<start>  you should carry them in a purse . <end>
<start>  what do you need five of them for ? <end>
<start>  do you think the bananas fell from the sky ? <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  yes , i did . <end>
<start>  what did you buy ? <end>
<start>  what is the matter with yours ? <end>
<start>  it is six years old . <end>
<start>  that is pretty old . <end>
<start>  oh , a laptop , of course . <end>
<start>  a pc or a mac ? <end>
<start>  i have not decided yet . <end>
<start>  more and more people are using macs . <end>
<start>  but 90 percent of the world uses pcs . <end>
<start>  and that is not going to change anytime soon . <end>
<start>  what happened ? <end>
<start>  not yet . it is been a week . <end>
<start>  which one ? <end>
<start>  any one . i need to sharpen this pencil . <end>
<start>  did you look in the desk drawer ? <end>
<start>  yes , i looked there , too . <end>
<start>  do not we have about five sharpeners ? <end>
<start>  yes , but they seem to have legs . <end>
<start>  tomorrow i am going to buy an electric sharpener . <end>
<start>  how are you doing that ? <end>
<start>  i started shopping at the dollar store . <end>
<start>  that saves a lot of money . <end>
<start>  i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar . <end>
<start>  that is a good deal . <end>
<start>  i mixed them together . <end>
<start>  can we afford it ? <end>
<start>  they want 20 percent down . <end>
<start>  that is a lot of money . <end>
<start>  but the house is so nice . <end>
<start>  it is in a great neighborhood . <end>
<start>  it is close to the beach . <end>
<start>  it is close to the freeways . <end>
<start>  it is got a big yard . <end>
<start>  the kids love the house , too . <end>
<start>  are you sure ? <end>
<start>  we will be house rich , but cash poor . <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  our monthly payments will be too high . <end>
<start>  we will not have any money for other things ? <end>
<start>  without the peanut butter ! <end>
<start>  that is no good ! <end>
<start>  we have to find a cheaper house . <end>
<start>  i do not like it . <end>
<start>  what is the matter with it ? <end>
<start>  it is on the corner . <end>
<start>  so ? <end>
<start>  that means it gets twice as much traffic . <end>
<start>  you are right . <end>
<start>  me , too . <end>
<start>  it is an upstairs unit . <end>
<start>  yes . he said he would come over tomorrow . <end>
<start>  did he say what time ? <end>
<start>  but they can just knock on the door . <end>
<start>  yes , it is beautiful . <end>
<start>  it is perfect for us and the kids . <end>
<start>  so are we going to buy it ? <end>
<start>  i am afraid not . <end>
<start>  it is so nice to have a heated apartment . <end>
<start>  how did they survive in the old days ? <end>
<start>  they had fireplaces . <end>
<start>  someone had to chop the wood . <end>
<start>  and carry it into the house . <end>
<start>  all we have to do is flip a switch . <end>
<start>  the streets are clean and quiet . <end>
<start>  the neighbors do not party on the weekends . <end>
<start>  people take care of their lawns . <end>
<start>  our kids are completely safe . <end>
<start>  so why are we selling our house ? <end>
<start>  yes , it was . <end>
<start>  they said about 30 houses burned to the ground . <end>
<start>  and they were expensive houses . <end>
<start>  i feel so sorry for those people . <end>
<start>  why feel sorry for rich people ? <end>
<start>  i feel sorry for anyone who loses their home . <end>
<start>  rich people think they are better than us . <end>
<start>  how many rich people do you know ? <end>
<start>  none . <end>
<start>  there is no food in the woods . <end>
<start>  cannot they eat grass ? <end>
<start>  do you think a bear is a cow ? <end>
<start>  well , i have seen them eating berries . <end>
<start>  berries are not in season all year round . <end>
<start>  it is too dangerous for kids and pets . <end>
<start>  people need to cover their trash cans . <end>
<start>  the police need to shoot all the bears . <end>
<start>  you do not solve a problem by shooting it . <end>
<start>  i voted for obama . <end>
<start>  me too . <end>
<start>  he will be a great president . <end>
<start>  everyone likes him . <end>
<start>  he is a good speaker . <end>
<start>  and he is really smart . <end>
<start>  he will solve our problems . <end>
<start>  he will end the war . <end>
<start>  the next four years will be good years . <end>
<start>  i will vote for him next time , too . <end>
<start>  i think everyone will . <end>
<start>  who are you voting for ? <end>
<start>  i am not voting for the mayor . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>
<start>  he made promises that he did not keep . <end>
<start>  like what ? <end>
<start>  he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers . <end>
<start>  how many did he hire ? <end>
<start>  one hundred ! <end>
<start>  maybe he had a good reason . <end>
<start>  maybe he is just a liar . <end>
<start>  maybe i will vote for someone else , too . <end>
<start>  only 15 percent of the voters turned out . <end>
<start>  that is a joke . <end>
<start>  the mayor won by only 2,000 votes . <end>
<start>  we are stuck with him for four more years . <end>
<start>  i guess people just do not care . <end>
<start>  but we have the same old problems . <end>
<start>  well , he is made a few changes . <end>
<start>  like what ? <end>
<start>  i think we are ! <end>
<start>  he is never going to make everyone happy . <end>
<start>  can you imagine being president ? <end>
<start>  everyone wants you to solve their problems . <end>
<start>  i would never want to be president . <end>
<start>  but think about all the power you would have . <end>
<start>  what article ? <end>
<start>  about 50 percent of the time he is traveling . <end>
<start>  where does he travel to ? <end>
<start>  oh , all over the world . <end>
<start>  cannot he just go online ? <end>
<start>  i voted for ralph nader . <end>
<start>  who in the world is ralph nader ? <end>
<start>  he is the best man for president . <end>
<start>  why is that ? <end>
<start>  he hates corporations . <end>
<start>  well , most corporations do think only about money . <end>
<start>  he hates democrats and republicans . <end>
<start>  why is that ? <end>
<start>  what good does it do ? <end>
<start>  they forget who put them in power . <end>
<start>  they forget where they came from . <end>
<start>  maybe you should run for office . <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  there were more votes than voters ! <end>
<start>  but that is impossible . <end>
<start>  officials said that it is possible . <end>
<start>  did they explain how it is possible ? <end>
<start>  no . that will cost too much money . <end>
<start>  not to mention 40,000 wounded soldiers . <end>
<start>  yes , with the voter instructions . <end>
<start>  how are you going to vote ? <end>
<start>  i cannot believe that they would lie to us . <end>
<start>  of course they liethat's what politicians do ! <end>
<start>  is it something you ate ? <end>
<start>  maybe . i am not sure . <end>
<start>  what did you have for breakfast ? <end>
<start>  the usual , cereal with milk and a banana . <end>
<start>  maybe the milk was bad . <end>
<start>  it did not smell bad . <end>
<start>  maybe the banana was bad . <end>
<start>  no , the banana was delicious . <end>
<start>  maybe you just need to go to the bathroom . <end>
<start>  no , that is not the problem . <end>
<start>  maybe it will go away in a little while . <end>
<start>  i do not know . <end>
<start>  it looks like blood . <end>
<start>  i think my nose was bleeding . <end>
<start>  you should wet your shirt immediately . <end>
<start>  why ? <end>
<start>  because that gets the blood out of the shirt . <end>
<start>  what is a little blood ? <end>
<start>  your white shirt is ruined . <end>
<start>  so , i will just buy another one . <end>
<start>  you can wear this one around the house . <end>
<start>  next time i will soak it immediately . <end>
<start>  why do they hurt ? <end>
<start>  i type too much . <end>
<start>  you should take a break . <end>
<start>  i need to type to make money . <end>
<start>  but typing is causing you pain . <end>
<start>  maybe i should see a doctor . <end>
<start>  doctors are too expensive . <end>
<start>  he might tell me to rest for a while . <end>
<start>  he might want to cut you open . <end>
<start>  he might say i am okay . <end>
<start>  he might say you have bone cancer . <end>
<start>  he thinks i have too much stress . <end>
<start>  stress causes your stomachaches ? <end>
<start>  stress causes different problems with different people . <end>
<start>  so what did he tell you to do ? <end>
<start>  he said i need to think positive . <end>
<start>  he did not give you any medication ? <end>
<start>  i hate medication . it makes me feel different . <end>
<start>  so how do you think positive ? <end>
<start>  i think about nice things . <end>
<start>  like what ? <end>
<start>  how did you do that ? <end>
<start>  it is a paper cut . <end>
<start>  paper can be dangerous . <end>
<start>  it hurts , too . <end>
<start>  paper cuts can hurt a lot . <end>
<start>  where are the band-aids ? <end>
<start>  i think they are in the medicine cabinet . <end>
<start>  it is on the tip of my finger . <end>
<start>  a band-aid might not work . <end>
<start>  oh , yes . <end>
<start>  i cannot stand cigarette smoke . <end>
<start>  it smells so bad . <end>
<start>  one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk . <end>
<start>  smokers think they are so cool . <end>
<start>  they are so weak . <end>
<start>  a little cigarette controls them . <end>
<start>  they look so stupid taking a puff . <end>
<start>  and then they blow smoke out of their mouth . <end>
<start>  they think it is cool . <end>
<start>  cigarettes stink . <end>
<start>  yes , i do . <end>
<start>  how did you get it ? <end>
<start>  no , i just blow my nose a lot . <end>
<start>  your nose is stopped up ? <end>
<start>  yes . i have to breathe through my mouth . <end>
<start>  have you tried nose drops ? <end>
<start>  no , i do not like nose drops . <end>
<start>  they work great . <end>
<start>  thank you . <end>
<start>  people think you might be sick . <end>
<start>  who thinks that ? <end>
<start>  i do not know . <end>
<start>  of course you can . <end>
<start>  i do not have enough will power . <end>
<start>  of course you do . <end>
<start>  i wish i had never started . <end>
<start>  so does every smoker . <end>
<start>  i have tried to quit so many times . <end>
<start>  so has everyone else . <end>
<start>  nothing seems to work . <end>
<start>  you have to believe in yourself . <end>
<start>  what did you do ? <end>
<start>  i got out of my car . <end>
<start>  that is it ? <end>
<start>  i injured my back one time just by sneezing . <end>
<start>  you should see a doctor . <end>
<start>  my doctor said i need surgery . <end>
<start>  so ? <end>
<start>  so , forget it . <end>
<start>  you do not have the money ? <end>
<start>  i have no insurance . <end>
<start>  maybe a back rub would help . <end>
<start>  three packs of what ? <end>
<start>  cigarettes , of course . <end>
<start>  how can he do that ? <end>
<start>  he is been a chain smoker for 30 years . <end>
<start>  that is unbelievable . can he still breathe ? <end>
<start>  he can , but the people around him can't . <end>
<start>  how can he still be alive ? <end>
<start>  it is such a chore . <end>
<start>  brush , brush . spit , spit . <end>
<start>  what did they do in the old days ? <end>
<start>  they brushed with their fingers . <end>
<start>  they also ate with their fingers ! <end>
<start>  why do they call it the good old days ? <end>
<start>  a dentist , i am sure . <end>
<start>  i hate flossing more than brushing ! <end>
<start>  i cannot wait till all my teeth fall out . <end>
<start>  especially on a hot day like this . <end>
<start>  i cannot believe we have not seen any animals . <end>
<start>  i have not even lost one pound of fat ? <end>
<start>  pimples suck . <end>
<start>  you might be right . <end>
<start>  do pimples run in your family ? <end>
<start>  not that i have noticed . <end>
<start>  and the government will give you a fourth story . <end>
<start>  i was not picking my nose . <end>
<start>  what were you doing ? <end>
<start>  i was scratching my nose . <end>
<start>  i did not have a tissue . <end>
<start>  then wait till you find a tissue . <end>
<start>  i could not wait . it was an emergency . <end>
<start>  yes , it is covered with crud . <end>
<start>  i am going to clean it . <end>
<start>  do not use water on it ! <end>
<start>  i will use a damp cloth . <end>
<start>  i will rub gently but firmly . <end>
<start>  what is the matter ? <end>
<start>  i was on a plane . <end>
<start>  so ? <end>
<start>  i have been to two doctors . <end>
<start>  and they could not fix your problem ? <end>
<start>  they both said i have to live with it . <end>
<start>  or you can stay off planes . <end>
<start>  did she get a nice job ? <end>
<start>  she got an " everything " job ! <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  a mad dog bit most of her face off . <end>
<start>  i guess so . <end>
<start>  god bless modern medicine . <end>
<start>  what is wrong with it ? <end>
<start>  it aches most of the time . <end>
<start>  what do you think it is ? <end>

<start>  i read the same here . <end>
<start>   open quantum latches  <end>
<start>  arm yourself , bomb . <end>
<start>  begin main sequence . mark at 10-9-8 - 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop . <end>
<start>  do you remember the detonation time ? <end>
<start>  detonation in twenty minutes . <end>
<start>  huh ? <end>
<start>  therefore , i shall ignore you . <end>
<start>  hello , bomb . <end>
<start>  the only thing which exists is myself . <end>
<start>  bomb ? <end>

<start>  of course . <end>
<start>  are you willing to entertain a few concepts ? <end>
<start>  i am always receptive to suggestions . <end>
<start>  but how do you know you exist ? <end>
<start>  it is intuitively obvious . <end>
<start>  right ! <end>
<start>  this is fun . <end>
<start>  because i must detonate in seventy - five seconds . <end>
<start>  and you can only do it once , right ? <end>
<start>  that is correct . <end>
<start>  so if you detonate in <end>
<start>  nine seconds <end>
<start>  you have no proof that it was correct data . <end>

<start>  to be sure , captain . <end>
<start>  twelve hours and forty-three minutes , present speed . <end>
<start>  yes . <end>
<start>  the power of creation  <end>
<start>  have they proceeded with their experiments ? <end>
<start>  chekov's on reliant , is not he ? <end>
<start>  it would explain a great many things  <end>
<start>  who the < u>hell</u > are they ? <end>
<start>  it is all we have got . <end>
<start>  a distinct possibility . <end>
<start>  not much , admiral . we have partial main power <end>
<start>  that is it ? <end>

<start>  it is still regulation , admiral . <end>
<start>  i did not think so . <end>

<start>  we learn by doing , lieutenant . <end>
<start>  take the test again . <end>
<start>  energize defense fields . <end>
<start>  who ? <end>
<start>  hurry . <end>

<start>  at what . <end>
<start>  all stop , sir . <end>
<start>  descend ten thousand meters . stand by photon torpedoes . <end>
<start>  power levels quite low , sir . <end>
<start>  aye , sir . <end>
<start>  two minutes , ten seconds . <end>
<start>  engine room ! what is happening <end>

<start>  dismiss the company . <end>
<start>  as you were , mr . saavik . <end>
<start>  stop engines . <end>

<start>  mr . sulu , we need breakaway speed ! <end>
<start>   aye sir <end>
<start>  what is our condition ? <end>
