<start>  my friend got a ticket for doing 75 . <end>
<start>  remember to put air in your tires . <end>
<start>  how often do i have to do that ? <end>
<start>  once every two months . <end>

<start>  the speed limit is 65 ! <end>
<start>  well , that is between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m . <end>
<start>  where are all these people going ? <end>
<start>  they are all asking the same question . <end>
<start>  when are they going to fix this problem ? <end>
<start>  they said they need more money . <end>
<start>  they always need more money . <end>
<start>  did you see that car ? <end>
<start>  yes , he went through the red light . <end>
<start>  can we call the police ? <end>
<start>  no , the police do not care . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>
<start>  they have to see it happen . <end>
<start>  so , what do we do ? <end>
<start>  we do not do anything . <end>
<start>  maybe we should honk the horn next time . <end>
<start>  my car is dirty . <end>
<start>  why do not you wash it ? <end>
<start>  that is what i am going to do . <end>

<start>  paper is flying everywhere . <end>
<start>  this wind is dangerous for drivers . <end>
<start>  especially for drivers of big trucks . <end>
<start>  the wind blows those trucks over . <end>
<start>  it blows trees over , too . <end>
<start>  a tree fell onto my dad's car . <end>
<start>  was there much damage ? <end>
<start>  my dad had to buy a new car . <end>

<start>  look how many cars are waiting in line . <end>
<start>  we will be here forever . <end>
<start>  get out of this lane . <end>
<start>  but we need to turn left . <end>
<start>  forget it . go straight . <end>
<start>  then what ? <end>

<start>  what difference does it make ? <end>
<start>  female singers are supposed to be pretty . <end>
<start>  singers are supposed to sound good . <end>
<start>  they should look good , too . <end>
<start>  there are lots of ugly men singers . <end>

<start>  have you told her ? <end>
<start>  of course not . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>
<start>  she would laugh at me . <end>
<start>  how do you know ? <end>
<start>  because they always do . <end>
<start>  maybe she is different . <end>
<start>  they are all the same . <end>
<start>  just ask her out to dinner . <end>
<start>  and then what ? <end>
<start>  give me a hug . <end>
<start>  i am not in the mood . <end>
<start>  what is the matter ? <end>
<start>  i saw you looking at that woman . <end>
<start>  what woman ? <end>
<start>  you know , that woman with the big boobs . <end>
<start>  i was not looking at her . <end>
<start>  you were , too . <end>
<start>  i am not interested in her . <end>
<start>  then why were you looking at her ? <end>
<start>  would you like to go on a blind date ? <end>
<start>  you must be joking . <end>
<start>  no , i am serious . <end>
<start>  to try something new and exciting . <end>
<start>  what if i do not like her ? <end>
<start>  i have a date tomorrow night . <end>

<start>  yes , it was pleasant . <end>
<start>  i had the worst date the other night . <end>
<start>  that is not a good start . <end>
<start>  then he did not bother to apologize . <end>
<start>  that is rude . <end>
<start>  then he drove too fast to the restaurant . <end>
<start>  i do not like that man . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>
<start>  he is a dirty old man . <end>
<start>  well , you cannot blame a man for asking . <end>
<start>  they should find a nice hobby . <end>
<start>  just wait until you are 50 years old . <end>
<start>  does your girlfriend ever make you angry ? <end>
<start>  sometimes . <end>
<start>  that was a nice thing to say . <end>
<start>  that is what i thought . <end>
<start>  what did she say ? <end>
<start>  she laughed ! she did not believe me . <end>
<start>  i do not mean good-looking . i mean good-smelling . <end>
<start>  let us go out to eat . <end>
<start>  that sounds like fun . <end>
<start>  where do you want to go ? <end>
<start>  let me think a minute . <end>
<start>  i feel like chinese . <end>
<start>  that sounds delicious . <end>
<start>  i know a good chinese restaurant . <end>

<start>  i would not do that . <end>
<start>  where do you get these crazy ideas ? <end>

<start>  an andy warhol drawing . <end>
<start>  did he sign it ? <end>
<start>  yes . <end>
<start>  so it is not worth much ? <end>
<start>  can we go to the baseball game ? <end>
<start>  of course . <end>
<start>  i love baseball . <end>
<start>  so do i . <end>
<start>  i love to eat the peanuts . <end>
<start>  i love to eat the hot dogs . <end>
<start>  i hope we will see a home run . <end>
<start>  i hope we will catch a foul ball . <end>
<start>  bring a jacket . <end>
<start>  yes . it gets a little cool at night . <end>
<start>  golf is a silly game . <end>
<start>  it certainly is . <end>
<start>  you hit a white ball . <end>
<start>  and then you chase it . <end>
<start>  what is the point ? <end>
<start>  how can it be fun ? <end>
<start>  they pay money to play this silly game ! <end>
<start>  i think golfers have a mental problem . <end>
<start>  do you want to go fishing ? <end>
<start>  yes . that is a good idea . <end>
<start>  where do you want to go ? <end>
<start>  we can go to the river . <end>
<start>  or we can go to the lake . <end>
<start>  or we can go to the ocean . <end>
<start>  let us go to the lake . <end>
<start>  yes . the lake is only 10 miles away . <end>
<start>  we can be there in 20 minutes . <end>
<start>  i will get our fishing rods . <end>
<start>  i will get the bait . <end>
<start>  baseball is fun . <end>
<start>  i like to hit the ball . <end>
<start>  i like to run around the bases . <end>
<start>  we have to practice every day . <end>
<start>  i do not like practice . <end>
<start>  me neither . it is boring . <end>
<start>  let us go jogging . <end>
<start>  that is a good idea . <end>
<start>  i bought some new shoes . <end>
<start>  are they comfortable ? <end>
<start>  they are very comfortable . <end>
<start>  how much were they ? <end>
<start>  they were on sale for $ 80 . <end>
<start>  do they help you run faster ? <end>
<start>  no , but my feet do not hurt anymore . <end>
<start>  then they are worth every penny . <end>
<start>  you might want to buy a pair . <end>
<start>  tiger is the greatest golfer in the world . <end>
<start>  you can say that again . <end>
<start>  but i am worried about tiger . <end>
<start>  why is that ? <end>
<start>  because he likes to scuba dive . <end>
<start>  what is wrong with that ? <end>
<start>  it can be dangerous . <end>
<start>  you mean he could drown . <end>
<start>  he should not scuba dive until he retires . <end>
<start>  but he dives to relax . <end>
<start>  did you watch that golf tournament ? <end>
<start>  the one that tiger won ? <end>
<start>  how did he do it ? <end>
<start>  i think he is from outer space . <end>
<start>  no human can do that . <end>
<start>  somebody should check his birth record . <end>
<start>  who is the greatest baseball player ? <end>
<start>  there are so many great players . <end>
<start>  yes , but who is the greatest ? <end>
<start>  i would have to say babe ruth . <end>
<start>  most people would say that . <end>
<start>  he changed the game . <end>
<start>  yes , he made the home run popular . <end>
<start>  everybody loved him , all over the nation . <end>
<start>  he helped make the yankees the best team ever . <end>
<start>  and ruth was a good person , too . <end>
<start>  he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids . <end>
<start>  did you hear what happened at the baseball game ? <end>
<start>  no , please tell me . <end>
<start>  someone punched out someone . <end>
<start>  that is not nice . <end>
<start>  it is worse than that . <end>
<start>  how so ? <end>
<start>  two guys got into an argument . <end>
<start>  i will bet they were drinking . <end>
<start>  a third guy punched one of the two guys . <end>
<start>  i want to go to the ball game . <end>
<start>  is there a game tonight ? <end>
<start>  yes , it starts at 7 p.m . <end>
<start>  can we get tickets ? <end>
<start>  yes , but only the cheap tickets . <end>
<start>  how much are they ? <end>
<start>  they are only $ 5 each . <end>
<start>  where are the seats ? <end>
<start>  they are behind the outfield . <end>
<start>  you mean like tiger ? <end>
<start>  no , like a good amateur golfer . <end>
<start>  did you hear about the ball player ? <end>
<start>  he said he was not using drugs . <end>
<start>  he apologized to the fans . <end>
<start>  the league suspended him for 50 games . <end>
<start>  that will cost him some money . <end>
<start>  yes , about $ 7 million . <end>
<start>  that will teach him a good lesson . <end>
<start>  is that it ? <end>
<start>  also , there are not enough police . <end>
<start>  but there are a lot of police . <end>
<start>  there is only one police officer per 100 criminals . <end>
<start>  cannot we hire more police ? <end>
<start>  no . it costs too much money . <end>
<start>  does not crime cost more than police ? <end>
<start>  yes , it does . <end>
<start>  so it would be cheaper to hire more police ? <end>
<start>  this is a great neighborhood . <end>
<start>  yes , it is . <end>
<start>  people are friendly . <end>
<start>  yes , they are . <end>
<start>  the streets and sidewalks are clean . <end>
<start>  yes , they are . <end>
<start>  there is a real nice park nearby . <end>
<start>  yes , there is . <end>
<start>  i feel safe here . <end>
<start>  there is no crime here . <end>
<start>  i wish i could move here . <end>
<start>  the house burned down . <end>
<start>  what happened ? <end>
<start>  the man fell asleep . <end>
<start>  was he smoking ? <end>
<start>  yes , he was smoking a cigarette . <end>
<start>  the battery was dead . <end>
<start>  a good battery would have saved his life . <end>
<start>  he had cigarettes , but no battery . <end>
<start>  they say he has started fifteen big fires . <end>
<start>  he is been in jail three times already . <end>
<start>  but his latest fire killed someone . <end>
<start>  this time they have charged him with murder . <end>
<start>  so maybe he will go to jail forever ? <end>
<start>  i sure hope so . <end>
<start>  someone should set him on fire . <end>
<start>  put your seatbelt on . <end>
<start>  but it is uncomfortable . <end>
<start>  it is the law . <end>
<start>  it is so much trouble . <end>
<start>  hold your breath till we get there . <end>
<start>  okay , my seatbelt is on . <end>
<start>  i am glad you do not complain very much . <end>
<start>  what are you standing on ? <end>
<start>  a couple of dictionaries and some textbooks . <end>
<start>  are you crazy ? <end>
<start>  what is the matter ? <end>
<start>  those books will slip and you will fall . <end>
<start>  yes . i called for a clean-up . <end>
<start>  a puddle of water is very dangerous . <end>
<start>  it is not easy to see . <end>
<start>  but it is real easy to slip on . <end>
<start>  especially on these slick floors . <end>
<start>  someone who slips could hurt their back . <end>
<start>  what happens when the fire alarm rings ? <end>
<start>  we tell our students to leave the classroom . <end>
<start>  can they take their belongings ? <end>
<start>  yes , if they do it quickly . <end>
<start>  where do the students go ? <end>
<start>  they go out to the north parking lot . <end>
<start>  i have to go back upstairs . <end>
<start>  why ? we are already late . <end>

<start>  of course i am sure . <end>
<start>  well , i have to go back upstairs anyway . <end>
<start>  it is getting later every minute . <end>
<start>  the city is buying guns . <end>
<start>  why are they doing this ? <end>
<start>  they want to get guns off the street . <end>
<start>  who would turn in a gun for $ 200 ? <end>
<start>  that is not a good deal ? <end>
<start>  i will keep my receipt and my gun . <end>
<start>  i did not know you had a gun . <end>
<start>  you are yawning . <end>
<start>  i sure am . <end>
<start>  you should go to bed . <end>
<start>  i will as soon as i finish this article . <end>
<start>  what are you reading ? <end>
<start>  it is about crime in los angeles . <end>
<start>  what does it say ? <end>
<start>  the mayor says the crime rate is going down . <end>
<start>  then why does everyone lock their doors ? <end>
<start>  people who live in california are crazy . <end>
<start>  why is that ? <end>
<start>  because of all the earthquakes and fires . <end>
<start>  but big earthquakes happen only once in a while . <end>
<start>  a recent fire destroyed 85 homes . <end>
<start>  still , it is safer than florida . <end>
<start>  but most of those hurricanes are harmless . <end>
<start>  i went to hawaii on vacation . <end>
<start>  did you like it ? <end>

<start>  i sure do . <end>
<start>  what time does your plane leave ? <end>
<start>  it leaves at 12:15 . <end>
<start>  when do you have to be at the airport ? <end>
<start>  i agree . <end>
<start>  you never know what might happen on these freeways . <end>
<start>  i need to fly to new york . <end>
<start>  when are you going ? <end>
<start>  during the christmas holidays . <end>
<start>  you would better buy your ticket now . <end>
<start>  i hate flying . <end>
<start>  now it is like riding a bus . <end>
<start>  people are always getting up to use the bathroom . <end>
<start>  kids are crying or climbing over you . <end>
<start>  it is a flying zoo ! <end>
<start>  i wish i could afford first class seats . <end>
<start>  some guy rowed across the atlantic ocean . <end>

<start>  did he set a new record ? <end>
<start>  what is the point ? <end>
<start>  are you going to travel alone ? <end>
<start>  i hate to fly . <end>
<start>  because of all the security ? <end>
<start>  no , because it hurts my ears . <end>
<start>  that is just the altitude change , i think . <end>
<start>  whatever it is , it hurts . <end>
<start>  cannot you take medicine or something for it ? <end>
<start>  i have tried everything , but nothing works . <end>
<start>  have you tried earplugs ? <end>
<start>  they do not work , either . <end>
<start>  spring break starts tomorrow . <end>

<start>  all day long we heard tvs or telephones . <end>
<start>  all night long we heard people snoring . <end>
<start>  housekeeping did not give us fresh towels . <end>

<start>  they need 300 new workers . <end>
<start>  and 4,000 people showed up . <end>
<start>  so many people are out of work . <end>
<start>  i still have my job , thank goodness . <end>
<start>  so do i , but i am worried . <end>
<start>  you would do the same for me . <end>
<start>  i think i did something real stupid . <end>
<start>  what did you do ? <end>
<start>  i bought some stock . <end>
<start>  everybody buys stock . <end>
<start>  i bought it on a hunch . <end>
<start>  so what is the problem ? <end>
<start>  i used all my savings on this one company . <end>
<start>  i was going to be a doctor . <end>
<start>  what happened to your plans ? <end>
<start>  i got a d in college chemistry . <end>
<start>  well , a d is better than an f . <end>
<start>  a tutor helped me get the d ! <end>
<start>  so , you did not become a doctor . <end>
<start>  and now i am glad that i didn't . <end>
<start>  why ? <end>
<start>  because you get to meet a lot of people . <end>
<start>  you sure do . <end>
<start>  and you get a lot of exercise every day . <end>
<start>  i want to move to new york . <end>
<start>  to the state or the city ? <end>
<start>  to the city , of course . <end>

<start>  what do you put in it ? <end>
<start>  just lettuce , tomato , and celery . <end>

<start>  did you get free food ? <end>
<start>  i ate free cheese and meat every day . <end>
<start>  i am on a new diet . <end>
<start>  what are you eating now ? <end>
<start>  i switched from pasta to potatoes . <end>
<start>  why did you do that ? <end>
<start>  pasta is processed food . potatoes are natural food . <end>
<start>  natural food has more vitamins . <end>
<start>  and it is just as easy to prepare . <end>
<start>  that is pretty simple . <end>
<start>  what is the matter with that ? <end>
<start>  it hurt her feelings . <end>
<start>  i eat the same thing every day . <end>
<start>  you are kidding . <end>
<start>  no , i am serious . <end>
<start>  do you eat fruits and vegetables every day ? <end>
<start>  no , i hate vegetables . <end>
<start>  there is something wrong with my orange . <end>

<start>  it is not orange ! <end>
<start>  your orange is not orange ? <end>
<start>  i love boiled peanuts . <end>
<start>  i will have to try them sometime . <end>

<start>  i am gaining weight . <end>
<start>  how much have you gained ? <end>
<start>  three pounds just this month . <end>
<start>  do you know why ? <end>
<start>  i think it is the ice cream . <end>
<start>  you started eating ice cream ? <end>
<start>  it was on sale . <end>
<start>  how much did you buy ? <end>
<start>  i filled up my freezer with ice cream . <end>
<start>  i like my food hot and fresh . <end>
<start>  you like to see it disappear . <end>
<start>  i am so full i am going to burst . <end>
<start>  you should loosen your belt . <end>
<start>  i already loosened my belt and unbuttoned my pants . <end>
<start>  i saw what you did . <end>
<start>  i did not do anything . <end>
<start>  oh yes , you did . <end>

<start>  you know what i am talking about . <end>
<start>  i do not have any idea . <end>
<start>  you know what you did . <end>
<start>  maybe i know , but how could you know ? <end>
<start>  because i was watching you . <end>
<start>  i like that shirt . <end>
<start>  so do i . <end>
<start>  how much is it ? <end>
<start>  i do not know . the tag is missing . <end>

<start>  i bought you a pair of pants . <end>
<start>  thank you . <end>
<start>  i hope they fit . <end>
<start>  i hope you kept the receipt . <end>
<start>  you think they will not fit ? <end>
<start>  i think i have put on some weight . <end>
<start>  you think ? <end>
<start>  maybe a pound or two . <end>
<start>  maybe four or five pounds ? <end>
<start>  my waist is bigger than it was . <end>
<start>  no problem . these pants have an elastic waistband . <end>
<start>  what do we need to buy ? <end>
<start>  let me look at our list . <end>
<start>  i know that we need milk . <end>
<start>  nonfat . <end>
<start>  of course . what else ? <end>
<start>  we need cheese , bread , and ham . <end>
<start>  what kind of cheese ? <end>
<start>  swiss . <end>
<start>  of course , the cheese with holes in it . <end>
<start>  i never used to buy swiss cheese . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>
<start>  i need some pants . <end>
<start>  i thought you just bought a pair . <end>
<start>  i did . <end>
<start>  but that is what pockets are for . <end>
<start>  i am going to take five wipes . <end>
<start>  what is the matter with the produce ? <end>
<start>  do you think the bananas fell from the sky ? <end>
<start>  did you go to the 99 cents store ? <end>
<start>  yes , i did . <end>
<start>  i need a new computer . <end>
<start>  what is the matter with yours ? <end>
<start>  it is six years old . <end>
<start>  are you going to buy a desktop or laptop ? <end>
<start>  oh , a laptop , of course . <end>
<start>  a pc or a mac ? <end>
<start>  i have not decided yet . <end>
<start>  more and more people are using macs . <end>
<start>  but 90 percent of the world uses pcs . <end>
<start>  i got ripped off . <end>
<start>  have you heard from them ? <end>
<start>  where is the pencil sharpener ? <end>
<start>  which one ? <end>
<start>  i already looked there . <end>
<start>  did you look in the desk drawer ? <end>
<start>  yes , i looked there , too . <end>
<start>  do not we have about five sharpeners ? <end>
<start>  yes , but they seem to have legs . <end>
<start>  i am trying to stretch my dollars . <end>
<start>  how are you doing that ? <end>
<start>  i started shopping at the dollar store . <end>
<start>  that saves a lot of money . <end>
<start>  i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar . <end>
<start>  why did you do that ? <end>
<start>  i really like this house . <end>
<start>  can we afford it ? <end>
<start>  they want 20 percent down . <end>
<start>  that is a lot of money . <end>
<start>  but the house is so nice . <end>
<start>  it is in a great neighborhood . <end>
<start>  it is close to the beach . <end>
<start>  it is close to the freeways . <end>
<start>  it is got a big yard . <end>
<start>  we cannot afford this house . <end>
<start>  are you sure ? <end>
<start>  we will be house rich , but cash poor . <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  our monthly payments will be too high . <end>
<start>  we will be eating peanut butter sandwiches ? <end>
<start>  without the peanut butter ! <end>
<start>  that is no good ! <end>
<start>  that is a beautiful house . <end>
<start>  i do not like it . <end>
<start>  what is the matter with it ? <end>
<start>  it is on the corner . <end>
<start>  so ? <end>
<start>  that means it gets twice as much traffic . <end>
<start>  i hate looking for an apartment . <end>
<start>  we would better get ready to go . <end>
<start>  did you call the manager ? <end>
<start>  yes . he said he would come over tomorrow . <end>
<start>  in case we have visitors . <end>
<start>  do you like this house ? <end>
<start>  yes , it is beautiful . <end>
<start>  and we can afford it ! <end>
<start>  so are we going to buy it ? <end>
<start>  it should be warmer in a few minutes . <end>
<start>  it is so nice to have a heated apartment . <end>
<start>  how did they survive in the old days ? <end>
<start>  they had fireplaces . <end>
<start>  someone had to chop the wood . <end>
<start>  and carry it into the house . <end>
<start>  this is a nice neighborhood . <end>
<start>  the streets are clean and quiet . <end>
<start>  the neighbors do not party on the weekends . <end>
<start>  we never have to call the police about anything . <end>
<start>  our kids are completely safe . <end>
<start>  that was a huge fire in santa barbara . <end>
<start>  yes , it was . <end>
<start>  they said about 30 houses burned to the ground . <end>
<start>  and they were expensive houses . <end>
<start>  i feel so sorry for those people . <end>
<start>  why feel sorry for rich people ? <end>
<start>  what does that have to do with it ? <end>
<start>  rich people think they are better than us . <end>
<start>  how many rich people do you know ? <end>
<start>  they should stay in the woods where they belong . <end>
<start>  there is no food in the woods . <end>
<start>  cannot they eat grass ? <end>
<start>  do you think a bear is a cow ? <end>
<start>  well , i have seen them eating berries . <end>
<start>  berries are not in season all year round . <end>
<start>  it is too dangerous for kids and pets . <end>
<start>  people need to cover their trash cans . <end>
<start>  the police need to shoot all the bears . <end>
<start>  who did you vote for ? <end>
<start>  i voted for obama . <end>
<start>  me too . <end>
<start>  he will be a great president . <end>
<start>  everyone likes him . <end>
<start>  he is a good speaker . <end>
<start>  and he is really smart . <end>
<start>  he will solve our problems . <end>
<start>  he will end the war . <end>
<start>  the next four years will be good years . <end>
<start>  i will vote for him next time , too . <end>
<start>  the election is next week . <end>
<start>  who are you voting for ? <end>
<start>  i am not voting for the mayor . <end>
<start>  why not ? <end>
<start>  he made promises that he did not keep . <end>
<start>  like what ? <end>
<start>  he promised to hire 1,000 more police officers . <end>
<start>  how many did he hire ? <end>
<start>  one hundred ! <end>
<start>  maybe he had a good reason . <end>
<start>  maybe he is just a liar . <end>
<start>  i cannot believe he won the election . <end>
<start>  only 15 percent of the voters turned out . <end>
<start>  many people think their vote does not matter . <end>
<start>  the mayor won by only 2,000 votes . <end>
<start>  how easy is that ? <end>
<start>  well , we have a new president . <end>
<start>  but we have the same old problems . <end>
<start>  well , he is made a few changes . <end>
<start>  who is paying for that ? <end>
<start>  obama's got four years to make everyone happy . <end>
<start>  he is never going to make everyone happy . <end>
<start>  can you imagine being president ? <end>
<start>  you and everybody else . <end>
<start>  i would never want to be president . <end>
<start>  did you read this article ? <end>
<start>  only 11 percent ? <end>
<start>  about 50 percent of the time he is traveling . <end>
<start>  where does he travel to ? <end>
<start>  he is visiting other cities to get ideas . <end>
<start>  who did you vote for for president ? <end>
<start>  i voted for ralph nader . <end>
<start>  who in the world is ralph nader ? <end>
<start>  he is the best man for president . <end>
<start>  why is that ? <end>
<start>  he hates corporations . <end>
<start>  well , most corporations do think only about money . <end>
<start>  i do not know why i bother to vote . <end>
<start>  why is that ? <end>
<start>  and when elected , they go their own way . <end>
<start>  they forget who put them in power . <end>
<start>  they forget where they came from . <end>
<start>  that election for u.s . senator stunk . <end>
<start>  what do you mean ? <end>
<start>  there were more votes than voters ! <end>
<start>  but that is impossible . <end>
<start>  officials said that it is possible . <end>
<start>  so are they going to hold another election ? <end>
<start>  only 4,000 american soldiers were killed overseas . <end>
<start>  did you get your official sample ballot ? <end>
<start>  yes , with the voter instructions . <end>
<start>  the title should be " better schools at huge cost <end>
<start>  i cannot believe that they would lie to us . <end>
<start>  i have a stomachache . <end>
<start>  is it something you ate ? <end>
<start>  maybe . i am not sure . <end>
<start>  what did you have for breakfast ? <end>
<start>  the usual , cereal with milk and a banana . <end>
<start>  maybe the milk was bad . <end>
<start>  it did not smell bad . <end>
<start>  maybe the banana was bad . <end>
<start>  no , the banana was delicious . <end>
<start>  maybe you just need to go to the bathroom . <end>
<start>  no , that is not the problem . <end>
<start>  what is this stain ? <end>
<start>  i do not know . <end>
<start>  it looks like blood . <end>
<start>  i think my nose was bleeding . <end>
<start>  you should wet your shirt immediately . <end>
<start>  why ? <end>
<start>  because that gets the blood out of the shirt . <end>
<start>  what is a little blood ? <end>
<start>  your white shirt is ruined . <end>
<start>  so , i will just buy another one . <end>
<start>  you can wear this one around the house . <end>
<start>  my fingers hurt . <end>
<start>  why do they hurt ? <end>
<start>  i type too much . <end>
<start>  you should take a break . <end>
<start>  i need to type to make money . <end>
<start>  but typing is causing you pain . <end>
<start>  maybe i should see a doctor . <end>
<start>  doctors are too expensive . <end>
<start>  he might tell me to rest for a while . <end>
<start>  he might want to cut you open . <end>
<start>  he might say i am okay . <end>
<start>  what did the doctor say ? <end>
<start>  he thinks i have too much stress . <end>
<start>  stress causes your stomachaches ? <end>
<start>  stress causes different problems with different people . <end>
<start>  so what did he tell you to do ? <end>
<start>  he said i need to think positive . <end>
<start>  he did not give you any medication ? <end>
<start>  i hate medication . it makes me feel different . <end>
<start>  so how do you think positive ? <end>
<start>  i think about nice things . <end>
<start>  i cut my finger . <end>
<start>  how did you do that ? <end>
<start>  it is a paper cut . <end>
<start>  paper can be dangerous . <end>
<start>  it hurts , too . <end>
<start>  paper cuts can hurt a lot . <end>
<start>  where are the band-aids ? <end>
<start>  i think they are in the medicine cabinet . <end>
<start>  it is on the tip of my finger . <end>
<start>  do you smell that ? <end>
<start>  oh , yes . <end>
<start>  i cannot stand cigarette smoke . <end>
<start>  it smells so bad . <end>
<start>  one cigarette stinks up the whole sidewalk . <end>
<start>  smokers think they are so cool . <end>
<start>  they are so weak . <end>
<start>  a little cigarette controls them . <end>
<start>  they look so stupid taking a puff . <end>
<start>  and then they blow smoke out of their mouth . <end>
<start>  they think it is cool . <end>
<start>  do you have a cold ? <end>
<start>  yes , i do . <end>
<start>  have you taken anything for your cold ? <end>
<start>  no , i just blow my nose a lot . <end>
<start>  your nose is stopped up ? <end>
<start>  yes . i have to breathe through my mouth . <end>
<start>  have you tried nose drops ? <end>
<start>  no , i do not like nose drops . <end>
<start>  sure . <end>
<start>  what is wrong with looking pale ? <end>
<start>  people think you might be sick . <end>
<start>  who thinks that ? <end>
<start>  i cannot quit smoking . <end>
<start>  of course you can . <end>
<start>  i do not have enough will power . <end>
<start>  of course you do . <end>
<start>  i wish i had never started . <end>
<start>  so does every smoker . <end>
<start>  i have tried to quit so many times . <end>
<start>  so has everyone else . <end>
<start>  then why cannot i quit ? <end>
<start>  my back is killing me . <end>
<start>  what did you do ? <end>
<start>  i got out of my car . <end>
<start>  that is it ? <end>
<start>  i injured my back one time just by sneezing . <end>
<start>  you should see a doctor . <end>
<start>  my doctor said i need surgery . <end>
<start>  so ? <end>
<start>  so , forget it . <end>
<start>  you do not have the money ? <end>
<start>  i have no insurance . <end>
<start>  my brother smokes three packs a day . <end>
<start>  three packs of what ? <end>
<start>  cigarettes , of course . <end>
<start>  he is a chain smoker . <end>
<start>  he is been a chain smoker for 30 years . <end>
<start>  that is unbelievable . can he still breathe ? <end>

<start>  i hate brushing my teeth . <end>
<start>  it is such a chore . <end>
<start>  brush , brush . spit , spit . <end>
<start>  what did they do in the old days ? <end>
<start>  they brushed with their fingers . <end>
<start>  they also ate with their fingers ! <end>
<start>  who invented flossing ? <end>
<start>  a dentist , i am sure . <end>
<start>  i hate flossing more than brushing ! <end>
<start>  this trail is hard to climb . <end>
<start>  especially on a hot day like this . <end>
<start>  all you have lost is some sweat . <end>
<start>  oh no , another pimple on my face . <end>
<start>  then maybe it is in your genes . <end>
<start>  you might be right . <end>
<start>  do pimples run in your family ? <end>
<start>  three different people will give you three different stories . <end>
<start>  do not pick your nose . <end>
<start>  i was not picking my nose . <end>
<start>  what were you doing ? <end>
